                    <div class="description">This website is one of the first websites I developed from scratch. This project was made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and it functions the same way as the usual food ordering sites. It was given to as a laboratory exercise during my freshman year. Looking at it now, there are some things that I could've improved on. However, given such a limited time, I believe that I did what I could.

                    <div class="description">This website was a project during the first semester of my sophomore year. We were tasked to create a diet optimization solver (basically a minimization calculator) using R as the backend language and any language for the frontend. I used RShiny which albeit is not a common web development language but it contains similarities to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript each of which I was able to integrate to my website using different modules.</div>
